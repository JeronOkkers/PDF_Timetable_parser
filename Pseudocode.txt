Iterate through timetable/
                        -Jeron
                        -shady
 directories.

FOR each student in ["Jeron", "Shady"]:
    directory = "timetables/" + student
    FOR each PDF in directory:
        process PDF

Step 2: Process Each PDF
For each PDF, send it to a ChatGPT agent and extract the timetable data.


SEND PDF to ChatGPT agent
RECEIVE JSON formatted data
Step 3: Upload Data to MongoDB
Once JSON is received, store it in the schedules collection.


STORE JSON in MongoDB collection "schedules"
LINK JSON with student's ID in the "students" collection
Step 4: Convert JSON to ICS
Use the JSON timetable data to create an .ics file for calendar integration.


CONVERT JSON data to ICS format
SAVE ICS file
Step 5: Send ICS via Email
Email the .ics file to the respective studentâ€™s email address.


SEND email with ICS attachment to student's email
